2. **Popular Products or Services:** Determining the top 5 most popular products or services based on transaction counts, utilizing grouping and aggregation.

3. **Daily Revenue Trend:** Visualizing the daily revenue trend over time by grouping transactions by date and summing billing amounts.

4. **Average Transaction Amounts:** Calculating the average transaction amount for each product category using grouping and averaging.

5. **Transaction Funnel Analysis:** Analyzing the transaction funnel by grouping transactions based on their type (completed, pending, or cancelled) and calculating total billing amounts.

6. **Monthly Retention Rate:** Investigating user retention rates on a monthly basis, including a week-wise analysis to identify patterns in user behavior over time.

**Technologies Used:**
- SQL (Structured Query Language)

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases the versatility and power of SQL in extracting valuable insights from a dataset. The variety of analyses performed on the transactional data demonstrates how SQL queries can be utilized to answer diverse business questions, providing a foundation for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
